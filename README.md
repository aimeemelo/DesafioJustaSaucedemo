Run  `cypress-cucumber-preprocessor plugin.` and `npm i @bahmutov/cypress-esbuild-preprocessor`. Required plugins to perform cucumber in cypress;
Configure cypress.config.js file. Configure specPattern with "**/*.feature" and setupNodeEvents added this setting:
> const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

>const createBundler = require("@bahmutov/cypress-esbuild-preprocessor")
>const { addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin } = require("@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor")
>const { createEsbuildPlugin } = require("@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/esbuild")

>module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    chromeWebSecurity: false,
    specPattern: "cypress/e2e/features/*.feature",
    async setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      await addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config);
      on(     
        "file:preprocessor",
         createBundler({
            plugins: [createEsbuildPlugin(config)],
